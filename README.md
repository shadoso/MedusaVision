**Medusa Vision**
Project in progress.

Medusa Vision is a DQN that receives an image as input instead of an environment.

- Notes: What is required and some tips
- Challenges: All the problems that I had to face.
- Methods: Why I chose to use that method.



# Notes
- OS: Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, RHEL, SLES, WSL-Ubuntu and ~~Windows~~.  
I strongly recommend you to use **Linux** instead of windows, installing CUDA and other resources is easier on windows but you will probably face some problems.
- Make sure you have installed: ffmpeg, CUDA, cuDNN, Python 3.8 and scrcpy.
- Python packages: cv2, torch, numpy, PIL, pyautogui and tensorflow.
